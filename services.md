## Lending
IOIO can assist you by lending a variety of electronic components and kits that you can use to build functional prototypes. When you get kits and components from IOIO, you will be asked to provide some information that helps the lab keep track of its inventory, such as your name and your student ID. You can lend kits and components during the open hours (Wednesdays 13:00 - 16:00).

### Kits
Kits are boxes that students you borrow when you need a complete package that with commonly used components. We currently offer three kinds of kits depending on availability or what platform you've been instructed to use.

#### Grove Kit

This kit includes an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Rev2 and uses the [Grove System](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/) to simplify the prototyping process. The Grove System uses a standardized connector with four wires: power, ground, data 1 and data 2. To use the system, the Arduino board is placed in a [Grove Shield](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_Shield_for_Arduino_Nano/).

The kit consists of the following components:
- 1x Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
- 1x USB Cable A - micro
- 1x Grove carrier board
- 1x Button board
- 1x Potentiometer board
- 1x Vibration motor board
- 1x Passive Buzzer
- 1x Addressable LED bar
- 1x OWIIC to Grove adapter
- 1x Grove Servo cable

#### Breadboard Kit

The kit includes the following components:
- 1x Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2
- 1x Large Breadboard
- 1x Micro USB Cable
- Connection wires (no precise amount)
- 1x NeoPixel LED ring
- 1x Micro Servo Motor
- 1x Potentiometer
- 3x Buttons
- 1x Piezo Buzzer
- x6-10 LEDs

#### Micro:bit

Micro:bit is a microcontroller developed for teaching environments by the BBC and a number of other partners. Students can use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (a visual programming language) to develop sketches for the Micro:bit. You can find Micro:bit learning material [here](https://makecode.microbit.org/).

## Services for non-designers
Are you an entrepreneur who needs a prototype to showcase an idea? An engineer whos needs user research for your project? Or a teacher who wants (their students) to understand what Interaction Design, Research through Design or Design Thinking is? Or maybe an artist who needs help with turning your concept into reality?

In IOIO, we can help with all of these and more. If you have an idea and not sure if we can help, reach out to us by email: ioio@mau.se, and we will come back to you as soon as possible!

Below, you can find examples of user research, design education and technical implementation, as services we have provided to our "clients" (students and teachers of MaU):

### User Research
We offer user research (interviews, workshops according to need, testing) for projects wihin or related to uni. The process is tailored to your project and your needs.

Example case: [Agnes and Eszti's work with Tiago](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QMKG4lYf3VNhi8xIgnVdwJ5lNJ5gR9adxqTc_57quVg/edit?usp=sharing)

In this case, we helped a dentist student conduct user research through an expert interview and two workshops (1 with users and 1 with technology experts). The link brings you to a reflection on methods we used to advocate for user-centered design in this highly technical case.

### Design Process Education
There are many other programs at MaU that overlap with IxD to different extents (e.g. graphic design, IT&economics). It can be benefitial to understand what IxD is, therefore, we offer workshops with theoretical foundations and gamified exercises.

Example case: [Workshop for Graphic Designers](https://github.com/I-O-I-O/.github-private/tree/eecd61cd06535fce027205042d3a17877e5451bc/assets/GB_IxD_workshop)

In this project, we were asked to explain to graphic designers what Interaction Design is in a two-day workshop. The link takes you to a folder with the presentations we showed - it consist of a theoretical introduction to IxD and of simple tasks for them to experience designing for tangible user interfaces.

### Technical Implementation
We offer technical implementation of smaller-scale projects for teams within/connected to MaU. This can be a prototype, or a smaller part of a bigger project.

Example case: QR scanner for the project [Material&Connection](https://s-p-o-k.se/sv/aktuellt/utstaellning-material-automation);

The "Material&Connection" is a collaboration between S-P-O-K, IUC Syd and others exhibited in the Southern Swedish Designer Days 2025. The robotic arm, the physical material boards and the web page for the material were provided. Our contribution was the program that scans the QR codes via the camera and opens it on a display. The link brings you to the description of the project.
